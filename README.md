# AutomaticModulationClassification
Automatic Modulation Classification or AMC uses mathematically modeled equations and sequences to predict or classify the modulation technique that has been used on a digital or analog signal. It is the intermediate step between signal detection and demodulation. 
The model used for this Repository is based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08908.pdf
