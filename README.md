# AutomaticModulationClassification
Automatic Modulation Classification or AMC uses mathematically modeled equations and sequences to predict or classify the modulation technique that has been used on a digital or analog signal. It is the intermediate step between signal detection and demodulation. 
The model used for this Repository is based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08908.pdf
The dataset used for the paper is RadioML dataset version 2016A which can be found at: http://opendata.deepsig.io/datasets/2016.10/RML2016.10a.tar.bz2?__hstc=24938661.919f48a146f2bb3749acf7ff984c816e.1598285581798.1599858294168.1600233446298.4&__hssc=24938661.1.1600233446298&__hsfp=4253523528
